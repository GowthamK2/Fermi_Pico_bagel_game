# 🔢 Fermi Pico Bagel Game (Python)

A simple and fun terminal-based number guessing game, inspired by the classic logic game **"Bagels"**. Use logic and deduction to figure out the secret number, with clues to guide you along the way.

## 🎮 How It Works

You're trying to guess a **3-digit number**, and here’s the twist:  
- All digits are **unique** (no repeats)
- After each guess, you'll get feedback to help narrow it down:

### 🧩 Clues:
- ✅ **Fermi** – You got the **right digit in the right spot**
- 🔄 **Pico** – You got the **right digit but in the wrong spot**
- ❌ **Bagels** – No correct digits at all

The game keeps going until you guess the number correctly!

## 🧠 Example

If the secret number is `548` and you guess `518`, you'll get:

```bash
Fermi Pico
